# STAT 201 Group Project
This repository was forked from a group member. Work was primarily conducted using Google Docs and individual Jupyter notebooks. We worked collaboratively throughout the entire project, in person and through online calls. One group member was responsible for uploading their copy to Git.

In this project, we analyzed the relationship between alcohol consumption patterns and student absenteeism using a real-world dataset of 395 students from two Portuguese secondary schools. After cleaning and restructuring the data in R with the tidyverse, we compared absenteeism between students who reported higher levels of weekday alcohol consumption and those who reported higher levels of weekend consumption. Statistical inference methods, including hypothesis testing through permutation sampling, bootstrapping, and Central Limit Theorem approximations, were used to evaluate differences in mean absences between the two groups. We also created visualizations, including boxplots, bar charts, and histograms, using ggplot2 to examine distributions and summarize patterns at the group level. The results showed no statistically significant difference in absenteeism between weekday and weekend drinkers, with a p-value of 0.267, emphasizing the need to consider multiple contributing factors when interpreting behavioral data and drawing conclusions from observational studies.
